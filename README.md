# Next.js router.push() Inconsistent Behavior

This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue encountered when using `router.push()` within Next.js.  Under certain conditions, specifically when transitioning between dynamic routes or to routes outside the `pages` directory, the navigation fails to function as expected.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.
5. Click the button to go to the `/contact` page.

Expected behavior: You should navigate to the `/contact` page.

Actual behavior: Depending on the specifics of your setup and routing, the navigation may fail or exhibit unexpected behavior.  This can manifest as the page not changing, an error being thrown, or unexpected rendering issues.

## Potential Causes and Solutions

The root cause of this problem can vary. This may stem from incorrect route definitions, issues with dynamic segments in your routes, or conflicts between client-side and server-side routing logic in Next.js.

This repository contains a buggy implementation and a potential solution.  Examine the differences in the `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` files to see the solution.
